# philosophy-visualization

This repository contains a structured dataset of major philosophical works in a single CSV file. The goal is to map the philosophical canon, allowing for analysis, visualization, and a clearer understanding.

You will intentionally find the same work listed multiple times. For example, Immanuel Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason* is listed under `Metaphysics`, `Epistemology`, `Logic`, and `Philosophy of Mind`, as it is a foundational text in all four branches.

This structure allows you to filter the dataset by a branch (e.g., "show me all works in `Ethics`") or by an author (e.g., "show me all branches `Hegel` wrote in") without losing the complexity of each work.
